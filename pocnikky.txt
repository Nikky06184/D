If you're looking for sample data to populate your loan management system for the proof of concept (POC), here's an example dataset you can use:

Customers:

Customer ID
Name
Email
Phone Number
Address
Loans:

Loan ID
Customer ID (foreign key)
Loan Amount
Interest Rate
Loan Term
Loan Status (e.g., pending, approved, paid off)
Payments:

Payment ID
Loan ID (foreign key)
Payment Amount
Payment Date
Payment Status (e.g., completed, pending)
Administrators:

Admin ID
Username
Password (hashed)
Email
Here's an example of how you can populate this data:

Customers:

1, John Doe, john@example.com, 1234567890, 123 Main St, Anytown, USA
2, Jane Smith, jane@example.com, 9876543210, 456 Elm St, Othertown, USA
Loans:

1, 1, 10000, 5.0, 12, approved
2, 2, 5000, 6.0, 24, pending
3, 1, 15000, 4.5, 18, paid off
Payments:

1, 1, 1000, 2024-01-15, completed
2, 1, 1000, 2024-02-15, completed
3, 1, 1000, 2024-03-15, completed
4, 2, 250, 2024-02-28, pending
Administrators:

1, admin1, [hashed password], admin1@example.com
2, admin2, [hashed password], admin2@example.com
This is just a small sample dataset to get you started. You can expand it with more customers, loans, payments, and administrators as needed for your POC. Remember to ensure that any sensitive information (such as passwords) is properly protected, and consider using placeholder data or anonymized data if necessary.
